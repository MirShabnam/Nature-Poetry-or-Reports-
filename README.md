Nature: Poetry or Report? is a Digital Humanities project by Eprene that bridges art, philosophy, and data to explore how humanity’s perception of Nature has transformed over centuries. By contrasting Romantic poetry with contemporary scientific reports, the project examines how a poetic, spiritual relationship with the Earth gave way to a mechanistic, report-based understanding. Using textual analysis, data visualization, and TEI-encoded corpora, it reveals that the exploitation of Nature began not in machines, but in minds—when philosophy turned materialistic and wonder was replaced by measurement. This project calls for a return to a consciousness where both reason and reverence coexist, reminding us that Nature is not merely a report to be filed, but a poem to be lived.
