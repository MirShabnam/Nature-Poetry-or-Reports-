      <note type="themes">nature_purity; memory; healing; moral_spirit</note>
      <p>Therefore let the moon
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
And let the misty mountain-winds be free
To blow against thee: and, in after years,
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
And these my exhortations!</p>

      <note type="themes">nature_sacred; albatross; blessing</note>
      <p>The moving Moon went up the sky,
And no where did abide;
Softly she was going up,
And a star or two beside —

O happy living things! no tongue
Their beauty might declare:
A spring of love gushed from my heart,
And I blessed them unaware:
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
And I blessed them unaware.</p>

      <note type="themes">sublime; storm; regeneration</note>
      <p>O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

...

Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawakened earth
The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?</p>

      <head>John Keats — To Autumn (1820)</head>
      <bibl>John Keats, To Autumn, Complete poem</bibl>
      <note type="themes">ripeness; transience; sensuous_nature</note>
      <p>Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook;
Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.</p>

      <note type="themes">innocence; moral_ecology; creatures</note>
      <p>To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour.

A Robin Red breast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
Predicts the ruin of the State.</p>

      <note type="themes">simplicity; nature_recovery; observation</note>
      <p>There was something cosmical about it; a faint, reflected light, a blue shallop skimming over the ocean of winter.
I had seen the red sunset glimmering through the snow-clad trees, and I said to myself, this is the right place and the right time.</p>

      <p>Unreal City,
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.

The river sweats
Oil and tar
The barges drift
With the turning tide</p>

      <p>My aspens dear, whose airy cages quelled,
  Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,
All felled, felled, are all felled;
  Of a fresh and following folded rank
  Not spared, not one
That dandled a sandalled
  Shadow that swam or sank
On meadow &amp; river &amp; wind-wandering weed-winding bank.

O if we but knew what we do
  When we delve or hew—
  Hack and rack the growing green!</p>

      <note type="themes">deforestation; warning; conservation</note>
      <p>The forests of America, however slighted by man, must have been a great delight to God; for they were the best he ever planted.
But the great pine forests of the West are being mowed down like grain.</p>
