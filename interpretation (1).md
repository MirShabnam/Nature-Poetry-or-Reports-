# Interpretation (Romanticism + Eco-criticism)

**Thesis**: Humanity’s relationship with nature drifted from **poetic admiration** (sacred, emotional) to **scientific documentation** (measured, risk-focused).

**Findings (Demo)**
- Poetry shows **higher emotional vocabulary** and metaphorical tokens (e.g., *river, sky, temple, heart*).
- Reports show **measurement and risk lexicon** (e.g., *discharge, anomaly, threshold, mg/L, decline*).
- Sentiment skews slightly positive in poetry and neutral-to-negative in reports (reflecting pollution/loss framing).
- Co-occurrence network blends nature terms with **quantification** in reports, vs **symbolic pairs** in poetry.

**Reading with Romanticism**: Nature appears as living presence and moral teacher.  
**Reading with Eco-criticism**: Crisis vocabularies encode loss, thresholds, and governance metrics.
